Automatically build a Dantotsu app weekly. To be more precise, every Friday at 6 am standard time. You can put this in your obtainium or whatever. If there are any major updates then I can always trigger a manual build. Also I use different signatures so the official app and my app won't be updatable. Meaning you can't install this build when you have the official installed and vice versa. Also I turned off debugging and firebase in this so it will run smoother. Removed the conments too. Before you login to this app, go to anilist settings and revoke access to Dantotsu then go back in the app, login and grant access. Any app issues should be directed [here](https://github.com/rebelonion/Dantotsu/)
