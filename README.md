Automatically build a Dantotsu app weekly. To be more precise, every Friday at 6 am standard time. You can put this in your obtainium or whatever. If there are any major updates then I can always trigger a manual build. Also I use different signatures so the official app and my app won't be updatable. Meaning you can't install this build when you have the official installed and vice versa. Also I turned off debugging and firebase in this so it will run smoother.
